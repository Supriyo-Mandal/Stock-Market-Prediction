This project aims to develop a website-based system for predicting stock market prices using machine learning algorithms. The system provides users with tools to analyze historical stock data, select an appropriate machine learning model, and visualize predictions.

## Features🚀

- **Machine Learning Models:** Includes LSTM, SVM, ANN, Decision Tree, and KNN for stock price prediction.
- **Dashboard:** Allows users to select different algorithms and view prediction graphs.
- **Accuracy Tests:** Conducts tests to evaluate the accuracy of each machine learning model.
- **Company Selection:** Enables users to choose a company for stock price prediction.
- **Model Evaluations:** Provides tools for evaluating the performance of the selected model.

## Technologies Used📷

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- **Visualization:** Plotly, mplfinance
